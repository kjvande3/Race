# Race
A base Unity example racing project that will be iterated and built upon until it reaches a complete game. The focus will be on creating a beautiful aesthetic front end menu system as well as incorporating elements in other areas such as a Leaderboard, better in-game speedometer, and other UI/HUD elements that need improving. May even take it as far as designing new racetrack/levels, implementing a multiplayer game mode, scripting some potential AI to race against when online players are not available, and even a back end database system for player/profile progression.
